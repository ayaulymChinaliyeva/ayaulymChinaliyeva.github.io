Hi guys
I will leave a number of thoughts here, hope you don't mind<br>

It's always about finding a perfect balance in your life. Between school, family, friends, work, personal growth track and MUN. For me there are 6 items between which I need to find a perfect balance, so that nothing will be left without attention. And somehow, I learned to handle it.
If I would be describing my day before the festival, it would be:
I wake up in the morning, then "make up" and go to school. After school I get to office and do my job regarding festival. In the evening I come home, and serve my family. After that I sit either doing my home work from school or preparing for the Test. Each Saturday I pay all my attention to MUN, after cleaning up the house surely. And on Sundays I used to go to church, however I have been prohibited, so I read or write music (actually I do whenever I have a couple minutes. Song might come to your mind even in the bus) and I can call my friends to talk. There are friends that I really care about, but we are in different schools. Zhake is like a little sister for me, even if I have two already. I want her to realize this is important to go chasing your dreams, not just sit and complain. This is a thing I realized currently, and now I want her to do the same. Whatever I learn - I want others to do the same. It's not like a trying to teach somebody life, but it's important for their sake. But people might find me arrogant when I try to tell them anything from my own experience. 
Crisis. This is something that shapes and stretches you. Only by experiencing stress, you will grow as a person, that is why I love stress to some point. I had some. Couple of them made me mad, made me cry, but made me stronger as well. 
What I think about these days is the dream I saw while sleeping. It's a dream in all terms, because I swear, I cried. I saw myself accepted to MIT and walking in the campus. And again, I swear to God, I was happy in my dream. Nothing felt so real. Nothing felt like this dream, because I found myself on the right place in this dream. And I swear, I don't even know, what I will do if I do not get into MIT. This is because I don't have a back-up plan. I don't have a plan for the nearest 5 years except one scenario which includes MIT. And this is damn not right. But I just can't help myself. I just do not like my life scenario that does not include MIT, and say whatever you want to. I know, it's not end of the life, if I don't get into it. However, I'm definitely going to be super unhappy. My unhappiness will be amplified with this rejection from average to max (this is everything I know from physics, haha, joking).

Nobody can predict the limits.
Technologies can be used to make it better for all.
Primary access to Internet could show them life can be better. There are places where you should be trying to reach.
A mobile app with all such women telling their stories would make her feel not so alone.
She says she spent her life on us, and now she is left without a job, a profession and any financial core in her life. She only hopes on us. But we can do better. Because if there would be a mobile app tracking her personal growth and that would help her find a dream job - could we do better? She will be happy. Because she was organizing different meetings with parents, to feel needed, to feel busy. She wants to be busy. She is hard working. And she will be happy.
You only need to believe in yourself, and stop telling you are a loser. You can do much bigger. Greater.
There are close people of inventors who were overcoming this pain behind all great inventions. Probably the people who invented the Internet wanted to have connection to any of their family members, relatives and friends wherever they are.
Some people live faithfully, with dreams and God in their minds. Because when you gratefully receive love of the God, you can make your dreams come true regardless all the facts and obstacles.
