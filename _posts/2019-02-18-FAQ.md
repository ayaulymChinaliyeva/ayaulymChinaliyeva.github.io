This is not kinda a method of telling that Imma cool and others are not. No. Just a number of thoughts of mine, which are really not giving
me rest. <br>
Most frequently asked question to me currently is: how much do you sleep?<br>
To be honest, fine. I sleep about 6-7 hours a day, and that's really enough for me. I just have no personal life and to be serious, I got 
alredy used to be busy all the time. Currently, yes, I've got some troubles with my sleep because of many deadlines, but I know, I'll have
more time later and after these dealines I'll sleep a bit more and will be fine.<br>
I'm fine. You don't have to save me. <b>Or ain't I?</b>
