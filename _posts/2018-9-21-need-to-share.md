How much your academic achievements can tell about you?
I got to find out what is this educational center about, and I was looking for a grammar nazi specifically. These people can look at 
your SAT, IELTS score, can look at the amount of certificaes you have and say: you are not likely to get into MIT. This is what they mean: 
you WILL NOT get into MIT with this portfolio. They say the essay is the most important part of your application to the university, and say 
that olympiades and achievements are what you write in your essay about. But. Wait. How can diplomas show how many books I've read? How can
diplomas illustrate how many songs I've analyzed? How can diplomas represent the number of lyrics, stories and melodies written by me? How 
can diplmas show quantity of sleepless nights doing your project or simple coding? How can diplomas say that you won a free course because 
you volunteered for orphans studying programming there? How can diplomas show that your project still lives and you with your amazing team 
received office in your 18, like if you already were businesswomen? How can diplomas illustrate your world within?
How can they show your mission, beliefs, objectives and values of your life? How can diplomas show how many skills you have? How can 
diplomas tell about you and how much you have done for the local community? Can they tell if you have a strong belief that serving 
public interest is what we come to this world for? No. No. No and NO. Diplomas can tell about your specific skills, they can be a 
supportive argument in your ideas and sayings, but... your ideas are written by the educational center! So what are your talks about? 
People change so fast, you can always notice something new in everybody. Hey, I'm not standing on one place as well! I'm growing as a 
person, and this is why I want to get into MIT. I will find myself in a differentiated community of people from different countries, 
nationalities, races, of different religions and different interests. This is impossible to lose yourself among such people, and only can 
happen if you are too easy and non-ambitious person. I do have one strong belief now and this is - serving the public. But the difference 
between people whom I had been compared with is that - I came to this belief by myself, and SOMEBODY wrote this idea for them. 
Individuality. I'm different from them, yes. I had problems with accepting myself so long, so you cannot come now and without knowing me tell 
that I'm stupid or that something is impossible for me. No. You don't know the full picture and you wanna make conclusions. This is the 
same as if you were looking on unfinished work of the artist and say that this is awful, but some time later this picture will cost you a 
fortune. I no longer can accept the comparisons between me and other "pockets-full-of-diplomas-from-oympiads" people. Because we are different
, our abilities are different, and possibilities are different as well. They compared me with that A girl, but hey...Does she have siblings? 
Has she ever lived in a house with garden, which needed your care and attention? Did she ever have to do something she didn't want to do 
(excluding studies for sure)? She had different people around and so did I. This is still so. I just simply want changes. In the world. And
I'll make them, trust me.
