title: My first song that I'm publishing
---
First of all, HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYBODY! <br>
I hope all your plans will be implemented this year, and you will be the one who reaches out all objectives for this year!
I'm happy to announce that I took up course "Developing your musicianship" on coursera, which is my first course exactly on this platform. 
Online education is good with its big advantage (which also belongs to NIS) - it is free. Of course, if you want to obtain certificate for completing
course on Coursera you must pay, however, you can still enjoy knowledge. Therefore, I'm just grateful for having this opportunity. You won't believe me,
but I don't have a piano which resulted into me downloading a "Piano" app on my phone just to have basic "Ear training" at least. My mom laughed. I think,
I just became so passionate about music, can't help it. Got an idea to train at school, because we have a piano in Assembly hall. I hope I'll be
allowed. It usually can be used for concerts only, that's why I worry. Nevertheless, always stand strong in faith. Yeah, I actually have good news.
I started talking about the course, because I completed first part "Major scale" and even passed the test for this unit on 100%. I was so happy
for it whole day, while it's just a test. That's important - to be happy for small things, 'cause you never know when you will be gifted next life challenge.
Well, I think I should stop here.
Here is the song... [enjoy it, please:))))) and yeah, it's short, but that's the idea, nothing is wrong]:

Name: Happily <i>//I would be happy, if you wrote me your comments regarding lyrics, I'm now working on arrangement. Will publish on soundcloud, once the song is ready</i>

<b>Verse 1:</b> <br>
Is rain the only reason for your pain? <br>
Or does it remind you of a better day? <br>
Or does make you feel all alone? <br>
Taking back just given hope? <br>

<b>Pre-chorus:</b> <br>
Do you really think there must be <br>
A good reason <br>
To bend in half and shout hysterically <br>
Every season <br>
It must have been love if you say <br>
"Heart is breaking" <br>
There must have been no mask with him <br>
No pretending <br>
But if you say your soul feels this time <br>
So dirty <br>
He must have been rotten inside <br>
Not sorry <br>
Do your best to clean up your memory <br>
From moments <br>
Where you smile next to him, feeling <br>
Happily <br>

<b>Chorus:</b> <br>
Do your best to clean up your memory <br>
From moments <br>
Where you smile next to him, feeling <br>
Happily <br>
