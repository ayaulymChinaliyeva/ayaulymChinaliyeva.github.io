title: Have you ever thought about willing to change the world?
---
I was talking about the amount of information that your academic achievements can provide about you, and now I want to tell what can define you 
as a human being. No, this things are not results of a big research, but they are just a conclusion made from my observations. And no, this is not a fact
built on many unique opinions, but only my subjective thoughts. To agree or not to - you decide. I'm going to tell you about 3 parameters, 
which to my point of view, identify your personality. Let's know what they are.
First of all, surely comes a <b>dream</b>. Your dream can tell much about you. Why? Let's compare a person, whose biggest dream's having a car, and a 
person whose biggest dream is becoming CEO at Google. People say, that dreams are abstract, but I must say, that they might be really precise and certain. First person doesn't know what kind of a car he/she wants, it's not specific, it's not big. The thing that dream is not 
specific says that you are not planning to implement your dream. If you are not even planning it, what about turning it into reality? The 
thing that dream is so small tells how limited your imagination and how low your self-esteem is. If you can't dream about anything
bigger than a car, then what are you going to do when car is in your hands? If you think that the maximum you deserve is a car, then how are
you going to realise such a great potential that God has put into you? Dream is not an achievement, but it can already tell much. It can tell if
you are able to think out of the box or not, your ability to be creative, boarders of your imagination and how perseverance you are. Ability
to dream big is also a skill, because a person who thinks that nothing is possible in this world (therefore is not even trying to dream) is going to sit til the end of his life without
even trying to act.
Second, how diversified people that surround you are. For sure, this side of personality can tell about your language skills, communication/networking skills, 
whether you are open-minded or not, and how smart you are. Let's talk about languages. Well, if you can speak only one language you are likely
to have many close friends and they are probably of different ages, which is not also guaranteed, which means you live in an aquarium of same
fishes as you, but not in an ocean that is full of different life. If you are good at making new friends, you are likely to have friends everywhere,
especially if you know the language (unless you can't talk to your friend). I think this is just clear, because you might have a friend from Spain,
who is an A-mark student-future engineer and a friend from Germany who is an daily office worker and singer in the dark. If you can be a friend
of both of them, you are good at understanding people, which is actually an important skill for international companies. Just imagine how many
different clients they have UNDERSTAND every day. You are not a person who loves sitting every day in front of computer or book without talking
to people, then you are the person who hears different opinions of DIFFERENT people and can manage to analyse them, have your own opinion, but
at the same time be aware of and respect other ones. This makes you a tolerant person and a good-mannered gentleman/lady. And lastly, but most
importantly - when you have many friends, but you don't fail to find common topics for talk with each and every of them, this shows how SMART
you are. Interesting right? You can tell me who is your friend, and I'll tell you who you are. Something in this way, but more like: tell me
who are your friends and how many of them you have, and I'll tell you some details of your skills and something from your personality.
And yes, thirdly. Tell me what you learmed from the last book that you read, and when you read it, and I'll tell you who you are. For sure, if you are that kind of a person who can't analyse a read material, how are you going to survive in this age of information? Moreover, are you able to obtain knowledge without understanding it? People are tend to be influenced by strangers' opinions with no personal point of view. To see and observe the world from your own perspective and be appropriate, wished worker on any job, such skill is a must-have.
Should I now talk about myself? Sure, this is my blog, I can do this.
Yes, I do dream about changing the world. The smaller dream is to travel around the world. And a smaller dream is to become a President 
(but who cares). Yes, I do have friends from all over the world and the networking like mine for isn't enough still. i wish I could be 
acquitance of each and every person among our 7 billion Earthers. And the last book that I've read is a Steve Job's biography (in English, 
yeah), and what I've found out for myself is a quote that I'll never forget. This quote is about how Jobs defines himself: "I've been 
always struggling if I'm not an engineer and businessman neither. But then I understood, that success comes to ones who can stand at the
intersection of both sciences and humanities.". Then I just understood that this is about me as well. I'm not fully at science, neither 
am I fully in humanities. I'm not going to die slowly inside just because I'm not a programmer enough or politician/writer enough. I'm 
just at the middle, and I'll definitely find how to use this amazing skill. All I need is to live in trust to God and be always on my 
to dream. Dream big, people. Just dream big.
