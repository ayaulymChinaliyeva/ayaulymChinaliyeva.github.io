title: Why BTS should serve in a military?
---
Sometimes fans don't consider the fact that Korean society is much different from ours. In their community - all males should go for 2 
years to the military and serve there, this is different from our country's exception conventions, when studying at school or in the university, being older than 25 years makes you "unfit" for the military. Even though I'm a female, and have no right to judge what the military looks like, I can surely say that the group will not be able to run away from a scandal, if they don't serve in the military. Even now, 
GD is having a scandal with people saying "you haven't hurt your leg for sure, you're pretending to escape your duty in the military.". 
That is why, ARMY, please, stop writing the government and asking to make BTS free from their duties. They will anyway go, regardless of what 
we say, so we only need to support them and say that we will wait until they come back together next time!
