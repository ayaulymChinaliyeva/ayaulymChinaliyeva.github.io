title: Why BTS should serve in a military?
---
Sometimes fans don't consider the fact that Korean society is much different from ours. In their community - all males should go for 2 
years to a military and serve there, this is different from our country's exception conventions, when studying at school or in the 
university, being older than 25 years makes you "unfit" for military. Even though I'm a female, and have no right to judge what the 
military looks like, I can surely say that group will not be able to run away from a scandal, if they don't serve in a military. Even now, 
GD is having a scandal with people saying "you haven't hurt your leg for sure, you're pretending to escape the your duty in a military.". 
That is why, ARMY, please, stop writing the government and asking to make BTS free from their duties. They will anyway go, regardless what 
we say, so we only need to support them and say that we will wait until they comeback together next time!
