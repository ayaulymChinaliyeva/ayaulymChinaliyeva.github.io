title: It's impossible
---
Hi, everybody
I hope you are doing well
I saw the analytics of the blog, and to say I became upset means to say nothing
I knew that I haven't posted anything for long, but did it really go so <i>bad</i>? <br>
Well, whatever<br>
Just came here because I feel super nervous because of the upcoming results from MIT. It's definitely <b>impossible</b> to be prepared to see the results. You can never be prepared for bad news, as well as for good ones. But I'm going to talk about another "impossibles".<br>
More and more people are starting to know about my application to MIT and I'm getting more and more scared of it. Because there's just one thing they all say: "It's impossible." Even my parents. Curator supports me, and he is the only one who says: "I understand what you feel". Does he really understand - I don't know. Nevertheless, I believe those words.
That's natural. People saying that it's impossible for me to get into "such" university. After a person with gold medals on olympiads, with excellent marks and performances on the exams got into this college nobody will believe a simple person can get there. But there is just one thing that really matters to me and that I'm curious about.<br>
How do students at MIT know how to serve the people? The thing is that you won't be able to understand someone's pain if you haven't felt the same. That's the reason why people in church will not be able to understand a drug obused person if the haven't had same addiction. <br>
Statistically, students from "good" families get into good college. Since their family hasn't seen hunger or poverty, they can really be considered as a family living in good conditions. My mom says, that depression about which the teenagers sing is just "getting mad from the fat". This phrase means, that you are so into comfort and have got nothing to do - you are creating sorts of illnesses for yourself just to pretend a victim. I just mean, that most probably (this is not a fact) - students at MIT, even if they come from different backgrounds, haven't really seen conditions that a simple girl from Central Asia has seen. I'm not sure, but maybe they didn't have a feeling of absolute upset when you can't afford any kind of educational courses. Or when you are studying at school with guys who are in the blacklist of local police and girls around you are not much better than boys. When your classmates hate you because you study.
Different. I have felt different almost whole my life. But not in a good way. I have felt strange, not special. <br>
Nothing can bring you up better than observing worst life conditions. To stay in your mind, there is a need to see it. Maybe one day we will come to one point.<br>
Again saying strange things. But I don't hate it anymore.<br>
I hope I haven't put you down, but I'm almost sure you're now upset just like me. I want to end this on a good note. I have passed my pecha kucha presentation today, which was about agism and "what does being adult mean?" I'm going to upload it somewhere on internet and will leave the link here. There is a phrase at the end of the presentation: you are amazing just the way you are. How do you think it's connected to the topic?<br>
If you would like to know, stay here or appear here on Friday morning. I'll write you.<br>
And surely <b>everything is <i>possible</i>.</b>
