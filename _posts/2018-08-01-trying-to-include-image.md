Guys...
I just started using this platform for my blog...and now i'm gonna try to put a picture into the post.
But i'm still puzzling to choose a picture
what to do...

never mind, gonna put a random one!
![Bishkek MUN]({{ "/images/bishkek-2017-10-06.jpg" | absolute_url }})
I found this photo, and you know what? Almost a year has passed since we went to Bishkek with NSWMUN OC to organize a MUN there:D
I must admit, I can understand why Kyrgyz people want to move here. Their capital looks like one of the southern-not-developed cities in Kz. Should the world be changed? Sure!
