title: Second part of my heartbreaking news, haha!)))
---
This week I talked to TED club's teacher, and she turned out to be a kind woman. Unfortunately, I didn't enter this club before, but I 
found passion for public speeches only several months ago, sooo - using my last year at school for this passion. What a pleasure and energy for me it is - to stand in front of many people and speak, pitch, present! Whoaaaaaa~heart is beating a hundred times per minute~ So, I decided to catch the opportunity, until I have it))
This is not to say the main reason of writing a post, we had a team-tea drinking yeaterday at the office))) wonderful, I love my Team! We 
are together almost a year, and regardless the fact that we are so different and have such a different and busy schedules, we always find 
time to meet, to work, to CONTRIBUTE! ~ahhh
Now, books and music. Last year I was holding a marathon of writing 30 reasons to live every day, so that I'll become with 30 reasons to 
live at the end of the month) my priorities, my world within, life principles, attitude and just totally EVERYTHING changed so much, I'm 
thinking about doing it again, haha. This is a bit strange, but writing them - helps you to think over each of the reason you're writing 
and gives a thought provoking idea. With each reason I always attached a book and a song, because maaan, BOOKS and MUSIC are worth living 
and worth being reasons to LIVE, but I can't write about them separately, because I'll write too much. Nevertheless, tastes change. And 
now, I can clearly listen to everything. I'm in LOVE with so many songs, just ~ahhhhh. I'm gonna do a playlist and explain why I love the 
song from it, man. I'll even start today, yeah! Did you know I write my own music? Yes, without any musical education and appropriate 
knowledge, I just record on a phone my voice singing a song, every time I have idea of lyrics or melody. Someday, I'll definitely have 
an album, haha)))))))))
And now, love yourself.
How did I come up with philosophy of loving yourself or accepting yourself?
To be continued...
