title: Application to the university of 1st choice. Status - finally completed
---

I finally finished my application to MIT. Last steps included filling the CSS profile and February updates form. Now, I can no longer think
about it, because as I think about it every day, I'm getting more unsure about to get into university. The thought that is actually rolling
around in my head - me standing on the stage with the presentation: How to get into MIT with no gold medals on olympiads? <br>
This is just the dream. One day, maybe. But if not, I must think about my plan for the future. And this fact is irritating. Ever since I 
met "my mentor" my decisions in life and my life as a whole is are so uncertain. I had a plan. Now I'm not sure about it. I'm not sure 
about the second version of the plan, because I've got no insurance in it in face of other universities. Therefore, I'm basically feeling 
completely lost. Is there any way to solve it?
