title: So many feelings!
---
When you are a person, with very big attention on details, people might think you are in love with them. No! I'm just very accurate about
little things around me and I usually pay a lot of attention to details. But sometimes I cannot understand other people, who are very impatient. He could call after the lesson or write a message, what a show of making a big deal with that. Probably it just irritates me or maybe I'm taking it to close, but why do we need this show - is the question. And no, I'm not suffering from the lack of male attention, this is not my style. But some people are cruel, and it hurts more when this cruel person is your sister. How can she think that I'm so unstable in my feelings when I'm still struggling with dealing with my first love? Another thing, when your sister laughs at you in front of so many people. I shouldn't take it too close to my heart, but I cannot do anything, and I'm just so hurt. This is one of the reasons why I didn't want to take group lessons. Only 3 days till one friend's birthday, and 5 till another friend's BD. What a mess, 
don't wanna do anything, for real. But I have to. I have enough power to overcome all my emotions, move on and fucking study. Hope you all do so. Goodnight:)))
