title: I finally did it!
---
Okay guys, I was gathering all the braveness nature has put into me just for this time - I'm now officially a publishing author! Okay, it's
a ficbook, but everybody start from something like that. I really like their mission, which I would like to somehow tell you in English (it's
originally in Russian, but who cares?): to enable newbies as well as professionals in writing publish their works freely, and let readers find
perfect book or fanfiction that matches their tastes. This mission really bought me. So today I published a very first chapters of my original
story - it's actually written basing on the Benny Blanco's song performed by Halsey and Khalid - Eastside. This fanfiction is just my thanks
for the summer in hugs of such a perfect song. So, I'm leaving you a link to my profile here, and if you ever want to read something from me
(for now - in Russian) - very welcome!
