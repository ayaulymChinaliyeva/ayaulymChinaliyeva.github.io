title: Why it's impossible for me to respect rappers?
---
  The music industry is growing every day, and since rap is becoming more and more popular AND genre doesn't require many of the traditionally
necessary skills, more and more newbies appear. What they actually do, is just "write about what you see, even if there might be no meaning".
They lead an easy life, literally "fucking bitches and spending dollars" and this is a consequence of significantly increased consumerism of people.
People don't even know what kind of music they want to listen to. Here, the effect of the crowd can be seen as well. Just remember how to strip
dancer - Cardi B became popular. One song made her popular, which is Bodak Yellow. Did you hear it? Then you know what I mean because there are
only 2 punches which made her popular in the whole world: "Hey little bitch you can fuck with me if you wanna". Read the first reason for my
disrespect to realize what I'm talking about. But basically, what I wanted to talk about was: why I can't respect rappers. Let's see the reasons.
  I have a strong connection with music regardless of my absence of musical education. I'm deeply in love with music, and after the years of listening
to different songs and compositions, I can bravely say that I can determine "bad music" and "good music". Surely, there are probably people
who will say "there is no bad music". I thought so by myself a couple of years, but thank God, I changed my mind. There is bad music. Bad music is music which can't even be called "music". Just listen to tracks released by famous rappers and everything you will hear will be the number of words
"fuck, bitch, shit, money" in the lyrics and trap beat (which can be found in any music editor these days). See something familiar? Then you got me. 
It's not music. There is no meaning, no message. A collection of curse words on a famous beat can't be called music. It can be called a product made for masses to earn money. When the music is made not because the author wants to express ideas, thoughts or convey a message, but for money - again, it's not music, it's a product. Because initially, music is an art. Will you be able to classify tracks of, for example, 21Savage as an art? No? That's the thing.
  Even if there will be a day when I'll be able to call what rappers do "music", recognizing huge work done on the composition, I don't think
there will be a day when I'll be able to say that I respect them. Because with the style of life that they lead they are spoiling the younger generation.
They promote crime, sex, drugs, and alcohol. When youngsters, including my peers, see that they enjoy such life, they want to live like them as well.
They will not even try to live their lives by themselves. The thing that I hate (yes, literally hate) is kind of the relationship with women they promote.
They only want easy-going, light-hearted, "open" girls, not even realizing that they - men - are the cores of their nations. Younger generation
will try to live like all those rappers - "easily", without promises or good intentions, and most importantly good relationships toward females.
Girls can forget about weddings or confession in love or vows. Females by nature always try to fit into the requirements of the men, and if men
will require "prostitutes and bitches", girls will try to and will fit in. They will become whoever males will want them to be but for the goodness sake,
WHY AREN'T PEOPLE TRYING TO FIT INTO REQUIREMENTS SET BY THE GOD? I finally came to this. Nations will fall if young generations will see value
in life that is represented by modern rappers. But fitting into the requirements of God is easier and life at the end, in fact, is happier. You simply need
to follow the voice of God, and he will implement his plan regarding your life which guarantees your happiness. Of course, you'll have challenges,
trials, failures and so on. However, you will never lack self-fulfillment or dissatisfaction. Just let God into your hearts to let him
help you.
I finally wrote my thoughts about these rappers "pseudo-musicians". I can't respect them, just because they are doing things not to better lives
of others. While nothing can be more important than family and public service. Live happily, dears. Be happy. And Merry Christmas, everybody! I hope
you understand the meaning of this celebration. Will meet you next year here:)) LOVE YOU ALL;))))
